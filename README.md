## Edamam Recipe API
This simple project is using the Edamam API, so if you are using this repo you will need a account and add your creds to pull from their services! [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/)

## After getting your creds
Add them to your .env file(you may need to create this file) as REACT_APP_<your variable name here>.  Because React looks for values prefixed with "REACT_APP". [Create Environment Variables](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)
